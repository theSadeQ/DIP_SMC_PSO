System Modeling
===============

Mathematical Notation
---------------------

The system dynamics are described by:

.. math::

   \ddot{q} = f(q, \dot{q}) + B(q)u


where :math:``q \in \mathbb{R}^4`` represents the system states (cart position and pendulum angles), :math:``u \in \mathbb{R}`` is the control input, and the control objective is to stabilize the system around the unstable equilibrium.
