# 5. Analysis & Verification Plan

## 5.1 Tuning & Methods
The controllers are tuned using **particle swarm optimisation (PSO)**.
PSO searches for sliding‑mode controller gains by minimising a weighted
sum of the **integral of squared error (ISE)**, **control effort**,
**control rate (slew)** and the **energy of the sliding variable**.  These
four terms constitute the cost function implemented in
`src/optimizer/pso_optimizer.py` and are the only quantities used to rank
candidate gains【732825508736690†screenshot】.  Overshoot, settling time and the
integral of absolute error (IAE) remain important performance metrics
for validation, but they are **not** part of the optimisation cost.

The contribution of each term in the cost function is scaled by a set of
**weights** specified in the configuration.  Under
`cost_function.weights` in `config.yaml` the default values are
`state_error: 50.0`, `control_effort: 0.2`, `control_rate: 0.1` and
`stability: 0.1`.  During optimisation the PSO tuner computes
normalised metrics for the integral of squared error, control energy,
control slew and sliding‑variable energy, and multiplies each by its
corresponding weight.  Larger `state_error` emphasises tracking
accuracy, whereas increasing `control_effort` or `control_rate` shifts
the balance toward reduced actuator usage and smoother commands.  The
`stability` weight scales the sliding‑variable energy and contributes
both to the cost and to the graded instability penalty applied when
trajectories fail early.  These defaults are taken from the
`cost_function` section of `config.yaml` (lines 260–273) and
correspond exactly to the scaling performed in
`PSOTuner._compute_cost_from_traj` via `self.weights.state_error`,
`self.weights.control_effort`, `self.weights.control_rate` and
`self.weights.stability`.

The search bounds for controller gains are defined under `pso.bounds` in
`config.yaml` and correspond one‑to‑one with the gains required by the
 selected controller.  Each controller class expects a specific length and ordering of gains, and the implementation enforces positivity constraints as follows:

  * **Classical SMC** – accepts a six‑element vector `[k1, k2, λ1, λ2, K, kd]`.  Here `k1` and `k2` weight the pendulum velocity/angle terms in the sliding surface, `λ1` and `λ2` set the slope of the sliding surface (1/s), `K` is the switching (robust) gain on the saturated sliding variable and `kd` is an optional derivative gain used for damping.  The constructor validates that `k1`, `k2`, `λ1`, `λ2` and `K` are strictly positive and that `kd` is non‑negative; providing zero or negative values raises a `ValueError`.  Exactly six numbers are required; extra values are ignored.

  * **Super‑twisting SMC (STA)** – uses two algorithmic gains `K1` and `K2` together with sliding‑surface parameters `[k1, k2, λ1, λ2]`.  A six‑element vector `[K1, K2, k1, k2, λ1, λ2]` specifies all parameters explicitly.  A two‑element vector `[K1, K2]` is also accepted; in this case the sliding‑surface gains default to positive constants `[5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]`.  Any additional elements after the first six are ignored.  The implementation requires `K1`, `K2`, `k1`, `k2`, `λ1` and `λ2` to be strictly positive to guarantee finite‑time convergence【MorenoOsorio2012†L27-L40】.

  * **Adaptive SMC** – expects at least five gains `[k1, k2, λ1, λ2, γ]`.  The first four define the sliding surface and must be strictly positive; `γ` is the adaptation rate that increases the switching gain when the sliding surface is large and must also be positive.  Fewer than five values cause a configuration error; additional entries are silently ignored to permit future extensions.  A separate proportional coefficient `α` multiplies the sliding surface (`u = u_sw - α·σ`) and is configured independently (default 0.5) outside of the PSO‑tuned vector【462167782799487†L186-L195】.

  * **Hybrid adaptive super‑twisting SMC** – requires at least four gains `[c1, λ1, c2, λ2]`.  Extra entries are ignored.  Positivity of `c1`, `c2` and the slope parameters `λ1`, `λ2` is enforced at construction.  Additional adaptation‑rate limits, damping gains and recentering parameters are configured via `config.yaml` and not part of the PSO‑tuned vector【895515998216162†L326-L329】.

  Optional tuning of physical parameters—including masses, lengths, centre‑of‑mass distances, friction coefficients and the boundary‑layer width—is configured under `pso.tune`.  When enabled the PSO evaluates each candidate gain vector (and any drawn parameters) across a suite of step and disturbance scenarios before computing the cost.

**Metrics:** The optimisation and validation use several metrics:
integral of squared error (ISE) over the simulation horizon (used in the
PSO cost); integral absolute error (IAE) as a post‑tuning evaluation
measure; percentage overshoot relative to the setpoint; steady‑state
error; settling time; and bandwidth and phase/gain margins from the
linearised plant models.  Control energy (integral of |F| over time) and
the squared control rate are also monitored.

**Robustness:** Robustness is assessed by varying plant parameters within
their uncertainty bounds as defined in the `physics_uncertainty` section of
`config.yaml`.  In the default configuration this corresponds to
approximately ±5 % variation on masses, lengths, centre‑of‑mass distances
and inertias, and ±10 % variation on viscous friction coefficients.  These
uncertainty draws, together with injected sensor noise, actuator
saturation and unmodelled disturbances, test the robustness of the
controller.  The controller must maintain stability and acceptable
performance for all sampled variations.

## 5.2 Datasets
Identification: `/data/raw/step/*.csv`, `/data/raw/chirp/*.csv`,
`/data/raw/free_decay/*.csv` and `/data/raw/multisine/*.csv` contain raw
experimental or simulated data used to estimate the plant parameters.
Validation: `/data/raw/step_validation/*.csv` and other reserved files are
held out for validating the identified models and controllers.

## 5.3 KPIs & Pass/Fail
| KPI ID | Definition | Target | Measured by (Test ID) | Pass/Fail Threshold |
|--------|------------|--------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| KPI-001 | Settling time | $t_s < 2\,\text{s}$ | T‑001 | $t_s \le 2\,\text{s}$ |
| KPI-002 | Overshoot | < 10 % | T‑001 | $M_p \le 10 \%$ |
| KPI-003 | IAE | minimised | T‑001, T‑002 | IAE within tuned bounds |
| KPI-004 | Stability margin | PM ≥ 45°, GM ≥ 6 dB | T‑002 | margins met |

## 5.4 Logging Conventions
Simulations and experiments are logged at **100 Hz**, corresponding to a 10 ms sampling period.  This matches the default simulator time step `dt = 0.01` defined in `config.yaml`.  Some controllers integrate internally at smaller steps (e.g. 1 ms for super‑twisting or adaptive variants), but all logging and nominal simulations operate at 100 Hz.  Logs include time stamps, full state vectors and control inputs.  Raw logs are
comma‑separated value (CSV) files under `/data/raw/`; processed summaries
are stored in `/data/processed/`.  Each log includes metadata such as
configuration hash, controller gains, seed and test ID for reproducibility.
